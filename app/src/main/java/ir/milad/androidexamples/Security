* Your Service should always be accessible within your own application
    use android:exported="false" in <service> tag of manifest file

* Use explicit intent to start or stop service
   usage of implicit intent is highly discouraged
        Intent intent = new Intent(this,MyBackgroundService.class)//explicit
        Intent intent = new Intent("my.intent.service.xyz.abc");//implicit

* Do not use intent filter for your <service> in manifest file

* To interact with service use Local Broadcasts
